During this time, I have honed my expertise in front-end and back-end technologies, collaborated on projects, and encountered and resolved challenges along the way. •I have worked extensively on different technologies such as For Programming Language - Java, for Back-End Spring Boot with Hibernate & JPA and Micro-Services, Database MySQL and MongoDB, for Front-End Angular & JSP & TypeScript & JavaScript & HTML and CSS.  PROJECTS  ❏ CAR PRICE PREDICTION (Used Python libraries such as sklearn, matplotlib, statsmodel, pandas, and NumPy) •This website lets you predict the car’s resale value using various parameters such as year of manufacturing, kilometres driven, current showroom price, and fuel type. •The data set used is of Car Dekho.com taken from Kaggle. ❏ BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION from histopathological images using patch-based deep learning modelling (Final Year Project) •A sample image is taken as input and compared with images already stored in the cancer-detected database. Pre-processing is performed on this image. If the detection is found to be successful, the appropriate treatment is suggested. •Algorithms such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are implemented, in which the pattern of connectivity between their neutron's is inspired by the organisation of the visual cortex of animals. ❏ LOAN PREDICTION PROJECT(Used Used Statistical tools like multivariate statistics, regression analysis and forecasting.) •Researched the types of factors insurance companies consider when reviewing loan applications. •Then generated several personas that represent people who have a wide range of credit scores and financial assets. •Finally, create an algorithm that assesses the most important factors and ranks them to predict the approval odds of each person.
