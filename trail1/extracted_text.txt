PRESENT
●
Development
with
FastAPI
was
a
crucial
role

was
one
of
my

in
the
project.

containers,
enabling
efficient
task
queuing
and
distribution
within
the
application.

I
managed
the
integration
with
Postgres
using
docker
containers,
ensuring
efficient
data
storage
for
linux
images.

Implemented
Swagger

of
API
endpoints
