# **AI Recruitment and Resource Fulfillment System**

## **Overview**
This project leverages AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the recruitment process. By extracting skills from resumes and matching them with job descriptions using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier, the system streamlines candidate screening and job recommendations.

## **Project Introduction**
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, traditional recruitment methods face several challenges. Companies struggle with manual processes that are:

- **Time-consuming:** HR departments spend significant time screening resumes and identifying suitable candidates manually.
- **Labor-intensive:** Recruiting for a large organization requires extensive manual effort due to high application volumes.
- **Prone to Bias:** Human biases often impact hiring decisions, leading to missed opportunities and potentially poor candidate fits.

## **Why AI?**
The AI Recruitment and Resource Fulfillment System addresses these challenges by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline and automate key recruitment tasks, such as:

- **Automation of Resume Screening:** AI automates resume screening, extracting relevant skills through Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match candidates with job roles more effectively.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** AI offers data-backed insights, helping HR professionals make more informed hiring decisions.
- **Elimination of Bias:** The system reduces human bias by focusing on data-driven matching, ensuring that decisions are based on candidate qualifications and job descriptions.

## **Features**
- **AI-Powered Resume Screening:** Automatically extracts skills using NLP to match candidates with relevant jobs.
- **Similarity Scoring**: AI generates similarity scores based on resumes and job descriptions.
- **Job Recommendations:** Provides personalized job suggestions based on skills.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can create, modify, and manage job postings, view applicant details, and perform CRUD operations.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (k-NN), NLP (spaCy)
- **Database:** SQLite3

## **Key Impact:**
AI significantly improves recruitment efficiency by automating labor-intensive processes, such as resume screening, skill extraction, and job matching.
By using AI algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), the system provides personalized job recommendations, reducing time spent on initial screenings and improving candidate-job fit.
The system transforms recruitment into a faster, more scalable, and objective process, enabling organizations to meet their workforce demands swiftly and effectively while maintaining the quality of hires.
